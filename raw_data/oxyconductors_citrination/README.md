## Oxygen ion conductors

### Data source
[Dataset 151085][https://citrination.com/datasets/151085] on Citrination.

### Description
This dataset contains preparation, structure, and property information for
oxygen ion conductors.
There are 3039 records with 2340 unique compounds and over 700 distinct
properties.
The three most common properties are crystal structure, conductivity, and
activation energy.
The most common crystal structures are Bismuth oxide (524 records), Fluorite
(520 records), and Perovskite (391 records).
The dataset was built with the support of ARPA-E contract DE-AR0000707 and in
collaboration with the Haile group at Northwestern University.
